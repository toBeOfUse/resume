        Major project in <strong>full-stack engineering</strong>. Worked with a
        small group of developers on an open-source social network website that
        received hundreds of signups. Focused on enabling content creation by
        giving new tools to users with a focus on a great user experience on the
        frontend and managing a complex database on the backend. Utilized
        <strong>Node.js, MongoDB, Vue, and SCSS</strong>.

        Spelling Bee Bot for Discord (January 2022 - Present).
      </h4>
      <p>
        Created a Discord bot based on the New York Time's Spelling Bee puzzle
        that currently runs in over a hundred Discord servers. Used the Discord
        API and created a core Python library that is published to PyPI.
        Utilized <strong>Python, SQLite, and modern Python packaging
        strategies.</strong>

      <h4>KSU Computer Science Tutoring (Spring 2023 - Fall 2023)</h4>
      <p>
        Helped Kent State University students from a variety of classes learn
        computer science and develop coding skills in C++, online and in person,
        as part of a team of tutors employed by the department. Had the
        <strong>highest number of students per hour</strong> attend tutoring
        sessions out of all the computer science tutors in Fall 2023. Utilized
        <strong>C++ and communication skills.</strong>
      </p>
      <h4>KSU Computer Science Research (Spring 2023 - Spring 2024)</h4>
      <p>
        Worked as an research assistant in the fields of distributed algorithms
        and software engineering along with graduate students and professors.
        Utilized <strong>academic research skills</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For my last two semesters at Kent State, I worked with both web
        technologies, native code, and the intersection of the two (e.g.
        <strong>WebAssembly</strong>) in Dr. Maletic's SDML lab, which is the
        highest-impact CS research lab at Kent State University.
      </p>
      <h4>Lesson Manager & President at HacKSU (Spring 2023 - Spring 2024)</h4>
      <p>
        Worked to create, edit, and present lessons on modern and practical
        programming tools and technologies as part of the student organization
        HacKSU. Utilized <strong>writing and presenting skills</strong>
        while drawing on knowledge of <strong>Python, React,
        MongoDB,</strong> and other contemporary technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, as club president for the Fall 2023 - Spring 2024 academic year, I
        <strong>brought in a new contingent of leaders</strong> to teach
        practical programming skills, conduct dialogues with guests from
        industry, and organize the 12th annual Kent Hack Enough hackathon, which
        brought in almost 70 students from 6 different universities to compete.
